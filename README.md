# Hacking-Arbiter-PUFs

This is an ML model based prokect which helps in decoding and cracking the problem of finding time taken by each signal in a combination of arbiter PUFs. (Physical Unclonable Function) generators. It runs Linear SVC on python to return training time and accuracy.
The inspiration for this project was derived from an online Machine Learning course of IIT Kanpur which I found to be interesting and decided to adopt into a self project.
